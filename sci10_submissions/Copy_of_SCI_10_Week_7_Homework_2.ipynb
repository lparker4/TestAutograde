        "In lab, you explored the effects of genetic drift using Shmoodies as our model organism. Now we'll introduce selection pressure into our model. It has been found that the `A` allele confers Shmoodies with high degree of immunity to a particular disease whereas the `B` allele does not. In particular, Shmoodies with the `A` allele have probability $p$ of living to reproductive age whereas Shmoodies with the `B` allele have probability $q$ of living to reprodutive age. We'll explore the impacts of these probabilities $p$ and $q$ in our experiments, but as probabilities they must be between $0$ and $1$ and, presumably, $p$ is close to $1.0$. Moreover, we should assume that $q < p$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we get started, let's take an aside on probabilities. Recall that in our absent-minded professor problem, the probability of a left move and right move was the same: $0.5$ probability for each of those two options. Imagine instead that the probability of a left move is $p$ (and, thus the probability of a right move is $1-p$). We'd like to simulate $n$ steps in the random walk process where the left and right moves have probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively, rather than $0.5$ and $0.5$ as before. We can no longer use `random.choice` because that function chooses options from a list with equal probability. Instead, we generate a number at random between $0.0$ and $1.0$ using `random.random()`. If that value is less than or equal to $p$, we generate a left move and otherwise we generate a right move. The code cell demonstrates this. Try it out with different values of $p$ between $0.0$ and $1.0$. Pause for a moment to explain to yourself why this works to generate a left move with probability $p$."

        "**A1:**Both Eugenics and Social Darwinism are outdated and racist applications of Darwinian notions of evolution to legitimize genocide and other applications of white supremacy. However, it is important to understand the difference between the two- while eugenicists advocated both for the restriction of immigration and reproduction of non-Christian and non-White individuals, Social Darwinists(using “scientific racism”) uses darwinian evolution specifically to argue for white superiority.  Furthermore, while Eugenics originated in the United States and moved to Europe(largely prevalent in World War 2), social darwinism was most popular in 1890s America, some half-century before the conflict.  Delineating the difference between the two helps scholars of both history and biology greater understand the impact of each on minority communities around the world.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social darwinism’s key idea- the application of darwinian evolution to justify racist ideology- completely misinterprets darwinian evolution’s key concepts.  Darwinian evolution explains why certain traits useful for survival(including, but not limited to, concentrations of melanin in the skin) develop in certain species in certain areas. Social darwinism fundamentally misunderstands this in several ways.  By classifying different populations of people as different species, then making them compete for survival with only one being “survivable” or ideal, social dawrwinists misunderstand the difference between race and species variation, and falsely asserts ideals of racial superiority that were never part of darwinian or mendelian evolutionary science.\n",
        "\n",
        "The eugenics movement used the ideas created by social darwinists, then implemented them directly into social and foreign policy measures.  This includes racial quotas on immigration into the United States and the Holocaust, among other things.  Scientists who followed eugenicists ideals were active participants in crimes against humanity and violations of scientific ethical codes.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the 21st century, with the development of CRISPR technology, there has been a new reckoning with scientific darwinism as the ability to genetically modify human embryos to prevent disease.  The 2020 arrest of Chinese scientist He Jiankui for doing so set a strong deterrent for the scientific community against the integration of social darwinist ideologies into medical/scientific practice, especially with the technology so early in its’ development.\n",
        "\n",
        "Although largely considered an outdated practice, both social darwinism and eugenics still continue today.  It is up to both current and future biologists and doctors to understand the history, reasoning, and faults of these movements in order to ensure that the scientific community remains held to a strong ethical standard in future years.\n"
