        "In lab, you explored the effects of genetic drift using Shmoodies as our model organism. Now we'll introduce selection pressure into our model. It has been found that the `A` allele confers Shmoodies with high degree of immunity to a particular disease whereas the `B` allele does not. In particular, Shmoodies with the `A` allele have probability $p$ of living to reproductive age whereas Shmoodies with the `B` allele have probability $q$ of living to reprodutive age. We'll explore the impacts of these probabilities $p$ and $q$ in our experiments, but as probabilities they must be between $0$ and $1$ and, presumably, $p$ is close to $1.0$. Moreover, we should assume that $q < p$.\n",
        "\n",
        "Before we get started, let's take an aside on probabilities. Recall that in our absent-minded professor problem, the probability of a left move and right move was the same: $0.5$ probability for each of those two options. Imagine instead that the probability of a left move is $p$ (and, thus the probability of a right move is $1-p$). We'd like to simulate $n$ steps in the random walk process where the left and right moves have probabilities $p$ and $1-p$ respectively, rather than $0.5$ and $0.5$ as before. We can no longer use `random.choice` because that function chooses options from a list with equal probability. Instead, we generate a number at random between $0.0$ and $1.0$ using `random.random()`. If that value is less than or equal to $p$, we generate a left move and otherwise we generate a right move. The code cell demonstrates this. Try it out with different values of $p$ between $0.0$ and $1.0$. Pause for a moment to explain to yourself why this works to generate a left move with probability $p$."

        "Social Darwinism and eugenics are theories that attempt to use the scientific concepts of natural selection and the survival of the fittest to justify political, economic, and sociological doctrines.  Social Darwinism was first introduced after the publication of Darwin’s On the Origin of Species and is now defined as the idea that the powerful in society are better and superior to the weak, largely due to being more “evolved”. eugenics was a movement that came out of Social Darwinism that gained track in the United States in the 20th century. Eugenicists believed that methods like involuntary sterilization, segregation, and social exclusion could lead to “racial improvement” by removing weaker and undesirable traits from society. In the United States, eugenics furthered a racist agenda, as eugenicists believed that black people were less intelligent, more criminal, and more likely to live in porverty than white people. American eugenics influenced people like Adolf Hitler. As a eugenicist himself, Adolf Hitler believed that the surivival of the “Aryan” race depended on purifying the country’s gene pool, and this led to the massacre of millions of people. Two centuries after inheritance and evolution were first introduced to the world, the topic remains highly relevant and charged with moral considerations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Social Darwinism was a pseudo-scientific belief that misapplied Darwin’s ideas. Prominent social Darwinists, like Herbert Spencer, believed that some ethnic and class groups were either more or less evolutionarily advanced than others. Spencer also believed that learned qualities, like morality and industriousness, were passed down genetically. From this set of beliefs, a variety of economic and political theories arose, many of which opposed welfare and laws that helped the poor, criminals, workers, and any other ‘genetically weak’ groups survive. One of the biggest faults of Social Darwinism lies in the fact that human qualities like intelligence or situations like poverty and criminality are not explained by biology, and thus, can not be inherited. Furthermore, Darwin’s phrase “survival of the fittest” refers to biological traits that make a species survive its environment, and it is misapplied when it is used to further racist, immoral, and unscientific theories and practices that attempt to violate reproductive rights. Thus, Darwin’s revolutionary discoveries and theories were misapplied to further a scientifically inaccurate agenda.\n",
        "\n",
        "The eugenics movement came out of Social Darwinism, and served as the basis for racist, ableist, and antisemtic movements in the United States and Nazi Germany. Eugenics in the United States gained track in the late 19th century. Large corporate foundations like the Carnegie Institution, Rockefeller Foundation, and the Harriman railroad fortune funded eugenics projects. By the early 20th century, there was a wide community of scientists and other professionals that promoted eugenic legislation; thirty-two states passed sterilization laws and at least sixty thousand people were unwillingly sterilized. The American eugenics movement specifically targeted the poor, black, and the “epileptic, imbecile or feeble-minded”.  In California, thirty thousand people were sterilized against their will. The impact of eugenics extended into Nazi Germany, where at least six million Jewish people were killed by Adolf Hitler in an attempt to “purify the Aryan race”. After the atrocities commited by the Nazi, eugenics fell largely out of popularity; however, the relevance of gene-editing for desirable characteristics has increased with the development of new technology.  \n",

        "Gene editing has become a fiercely debated topic in the scientific community, largely due to CRISPR, which has enabled scientists to modify the genetic code. CRISPR technology is mainly used to further research into diseases like cancer and mental illnesses. In 2018, however, He Jiankui illegaly used the technology to modify human embrios. This created a wave of reactions that brought to the forefront the possibility of modifying the human genome. The fact that the modification of human DNA is possible raises a variety of questions about the morality of the practice. Among these: what is a desirable genome? Who gets access to the technology? What are the societal, political, and economic implications of having genetically modified humans? Despite the scientific breakthroughs that CRISPR entails, there are still many conversations to be had regarding its use.\n",

        "The science of evolution and inheritance was first introduced to the world in the 19th century, primarily by the advancements made by Charles Darwin. His discoveries, however, were unscientifcaly and immoraly used to further exclusionary theories, legislations, and practices, like Social Darwinism and eugenics,  that resulted in the deaths and sterilizations of millions of people. As the understanding of the genetic code increases and the technology that allows for the modification of the genome becomes more accessible, many questions are, and should be, raised. In the 21st century, it is important to hold scientists and communities accountable to ensure that scientific knowledge is used morally and safely to further only the common good.\n"
