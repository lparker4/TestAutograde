    "Your assignment will be evaluated by both an autograder and grutor.\n",
    "The autograder will execute your notebook once, and some test functions will be run on the results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example recommendations from the autograder library**\n",
    "- Submit valid _Python3_ code only!\n",
    "- Use **external** libraries if and only if specified by task.\n",
    "  Using the standard library is fine unless you are told otherwise.\n",
    "- Ensure your definitions (functions, classes, methods, variables) follow the specification.\n",
    "  The signature of a function/method/class usually can be inferred from task description, code skeletons and test cases.\n",
    "- Ensure your code does not rely on the current notebook or system state!\n",
    "  - Use `Kernel > Restart & Run All` to see if you are using any definitions, variables etc. that are not in scope anymore.\n",
    "  - Double check if your code relies on presence of files or directories other than those mentioned in given tasks.\n",
    "  - Tests run under Linux, hence do not use Windows style paths (`some\\path`, `C:\\another\\path`).\n",
    "    `pathlib` provides neat abstractions for that, use it!\n",
    "    Also, use paths only that are relative to and within your working directory (OK: `some/path`, `./some/path`; NOT OK: `/home/alice/python`, `../../python`).\n",
    "- Keep your code [idempotent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence)!\n",
    "  Running your code or parts of it multiple times must not yield different results.\n",
    "  Minimize usage of global variables.\n",
    "- Ensure your code/notebook terminates in reasonable time.\n",
    "  We enforce timeouts during notebook/test execution.\n",
    "  Exceeding those results in an error and potentially no points for that sub-task.\n",
    "- Textual answers must always be backed by code and may not refer to results that are not part of your submission.\n",
    "- Do not use IPython special commands (lines starting with `%` or `!`).\n",
